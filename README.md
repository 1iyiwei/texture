This is the (latest?) texture synthesis code I wrote around 2014.
The goal is simplicity and reasonably good quality, so I have not attempted to incorporate the state-of-art algorithms or to optimize memory or speed.

## Build ##

Go to the build folder, and run cmake from there.

## Run ##

Under the build folder, run bin/test.sh, and see the input and output under the data folder.
