# Texture Synthesis #

This is the latest texture synthesis code I wrote around 2014.
The goal is designed for simplicity and reasonably good quality, so I have not attemped to incorporate the state-of-art algorithms or to optimize memory or speed.

## Build ##

Go to the build folder, and run cmake from there.

## Run ##

Under the build folder, run bin/test.sh, and see the input and output under the data folder.
