\section{Usage}
\label{sec:interface}

The entire code can be compiled via CMake.

Please make sure you have ImageMagick installed, and its bin folder under your path.
We rely on its convert command extensively for image format conversion and basic image processing.
Please also install python for running the scripts.

\filename{test.py} is an example Python script for ordinary texture synthesis without constraints.

\filename{urc_test.py} is an example Python script for running the binary test data with various options explained in the comments.

It is best to cmake everything under a \foldername{build} folder in parallel with \foldername{src}, and invoke the script from there.
