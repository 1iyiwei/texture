\section{Introduction}

As a combination of multi-resolution \cite{Wei:2000:FTS}, k-coherence \cite{Tong:2002:SBT}, and randomized search \cite{Barnes:2009:PRC}, this is a very simple and yet effective texture synthesis method without requiring any training or large neural networks as in recent deep learning methods (see \cite{Gatys:2016:IST} and the follow up works), which are more suitable for style transfer or other advanced applications.
